Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems

The Sliding Window Technique is a way to efficiently move through a portion (or "window") of data (usually an array or string)
without having to reprocess everything from scratch each time.
Instead of nested loops (which are slow for large inputs), we maintain a "window" of size k or dynamic length and
slide it over the input â€” usually using two pointers (left and right)

 Benefits
Efficient: Reduces unnecessary re-computation

Optimized for large inputs

Clean and intuitive logic once mastered
